# 3-list

For this exercise you must set up HTML/CSS/JavaScript files and write code to create a list.  Once you've completed the lists above, you an use that code to help you do this.  

Once you have to current list working, modify the code such that when you click on the list to indicate done, it move the item to a "Done" list that you'll add to your HTML.  The "Done" list doesn't need to be in the form as it will not change.

You can use jQuery or Vanilla JS.
